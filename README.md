Our Mission: Project EVO — Robotics for the Next Frontier
We’re building bold, adaptable robots designed to explore land, sea, and the edge of space. From our humble workspace, Nate and TechGhost are developing Spider V1—an eight-legged robotic prototype built to evolve with the environment it navigates.

This isn’t just a build. It’s a movement—to make advanced robotics accessible, modular, and inspiring. With your support, we’ll prototype, test, and share every step—from 3D prints and servo designs to AI-driven terrain adaptation.

Whether you're into engineering, exploration, or just want to be part of something new, your donation fuels the future—and helps us teach others how to build it too.
